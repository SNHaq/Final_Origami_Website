    <h2><u>About My Website!</u></h2>

    <h3>This website was designed to help teach people the art of
        origami! Many people believe that origami is very complex and 
        hard, however, that isn't true. Origami is actually quite 
        simple, and is extremely relaxing. In this website I have listed
        several of my favorite origami animals to fold. I hope that you
         find this website useful and develop a passion for origami!
    </h3>

    <h2><u>Why I Created This Website</u></h2>

    <h3>When I was first starting origami, I thought that it would be extremely 
        hard, but I was extremely wrong! Thanks to tutorials like these, I was able 
        to pick it up really fast! I hope that my website helps others develop a 
        newfound passion for origami! I created this website so that I could share 
        and express my passion for origami! I also created this website to help 
        introduce more people to the art of orgami.
